    "Let’s say we want to build a linear regression model to predict the house prices based on some features, such as the number of rooms, the size of the house, the location, etc. We have a training dataset of 100 houses with their features and prices, and we want to use gradient descent to find the optimal weights for our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we notice that our model is overfitting the training data, meaning that it has a very low training error but a high test error when we evaluate it on new data. This means that our model is too complex and it learns the noise in the training data instead of the general patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overfitting, we can use regularization techniques such as L2 or L1 regularization. These techniques add a penalty term to the loss function that depends on the magnitude of the weights. The penalty term makes the model prefer smaller weights and reduces the complexity of the model.\n",

    "For example, if we use L2 regularization, our loss function becomes:\n",
